# AudioVTuber
A vtuber app for those without camera

As in like, it uses Audio to detect emotion and change facial expression based on that

Instead of using keyboard

Best used with PngTuber instead of full on animated Vtuber model

Really, this is made for those with low device and such...

Installation coming soon, I haven't even started yet.


## ToDo:

- Make a Window to Show the Vtuber
- Toggle with numbers, for now
- Make a simple UI to set things up
- Add the AI Model integration
- Make a better AI Model (the current one uses OpenSense, good, but not enough emotion)
- Add more features as they came along
